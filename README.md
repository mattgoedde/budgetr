## About

[Budgetr](https://budgetr.app) is a financial planning tool. It provides an easy way for individuals to account for all of their expenses and normalize them into a common timeframe. For example, a person is paid bi-weekly, pays their mortgage and insurances monthly, property taxes bi-annually, and grocery shops weekly. Budgetr will seemlessly calculate their weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly budget.
